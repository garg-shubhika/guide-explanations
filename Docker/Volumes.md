### Introduction
Volumes in Docker are a mechanism for persisting data generated or used by containers. Unlike data inside the containerâ€™s filesystem, which is ephemeral and lost when the container is stopped or deleted, volumes allow you to store data outside of the container's filesystem, ensuring it remains persistent and available even when containers are recreated, updated, or removed.

### Dockerfile Example

```bash
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set environment variables
ENV APP_ENV=production

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application code
COPY app.py .

# Create a directory inside the container to store data
RUN mkdir /data

# Define /data as a volume
VOLUME /data

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

```
