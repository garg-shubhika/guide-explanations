Docker Compose is a tool that simplifies the process of defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to manage multiple containers with a single configuration file, making it easier to orchestrate the interactions between different services (e.g., databases, web servers, APIs, etc.) in a consistent and scalable manner.

Docker Compose allows you to define and manage multiple services within a single environment. Instead of managing each container individually, you can use a docker-compose.yml file to specify all the containers and their configurations.
